# Guided Project - Checking Out Code From GitHub

## Introduction

In previous lessons we have installed Git and created a GitHub account. In this lesson we will go through the typical workflow in a Git project.

## Creating a New Repository

In this lesson we will learn to create a new repo and initialize the repo. First, we navigate to [GitHub](https://www.github.com). Clicking the plus sign on the top right opens a menu. Select "New repository" from the menu.

Now select a name for the repository. In this lesson I will name the repo `super-duper-robot`. However, you may choose any name you like. There is no strict convention for naming repositories. However, most developers use lower case letters only and separate the words with dashes.

Additionally, make sure to check the box to initialize the repository with a `README`. This file will contain a brief description of your project.

## Cloning the Repo

Currently this repository contains only a `README` file. However, we will clone it to make a local copy. This means that we can work on the repo locally, add more files, and then commit our changes to the remote copy of the repository in GitHub.

To copy the repo, we first copy the link from the green button in the top right corner. we then start up the terminal and navigate to a folder one level above where we want to place our new super-duper-robot repository. 

We use the `git clone` command. We type the command into the terminal and should see the following output:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/super-duper-robot.git
Cloning into 'super-duper-robot'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
```

:warning: Replace `<username>` with your own Github username.

## Adding New Files to the Repo
 
We now navigate to the folder where we cloned the repository using the `cd` command:

```
$ cd super-duper-robot
```

We can add a new file. In this case, to simplify things, we will add another `.md` file. This file will contain more documentation. Let's name this file `robot.md` and place it beside the `README` file.

To ensure that the new file has been added to the repo, type the command:

```
$ git add .
```

This command will ensure that all new files in the folder will be added to the repo. If we want to add only specific files and not all files, then we can type `git add` followed by the file path.

## Checking the Status of Our Repo

we can use the `git status` command to ensure that the file was added and is now being tracked by git.

```
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   robot.md
```

This status tells us that we have added the file and our next step should be committing the file. 

`git status` can let us know about the state of our repo and identify issues in case we get an error message while typing a git command.

## Committing Our Changes

We should commit often to save our work. In order to commit our changes to the repo, we use the `git commit` command. It is important to add the `-m` option and a commit message. Commit messages are important since they describe what major changes happened in this commit.

For example, for our super-duper-robot repo, we will have the following commit message:

```
$ git commit -m "adding robot.md to the repository"
[master 50dce7f] adding robot.md to the repository
1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
create mode 100644 robot.md
```

## Pushing Our Changes

The final step in this process is to push the changes to the remote repo in GitHub. We do this with the following command:

```
$ git push
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 349 bytes | 349.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/<username>/super-duper-robot.git
   c67eacf..50dce7f  master -> master
```

If you see the output above then your code should now be in the GitHub repository!

:information_source: If you created the repository locally rather than cloning it from Github, you will have to define your remote repository location before you can push your source code to Github. Refer to [this tutorial on Git remote syncing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing).
