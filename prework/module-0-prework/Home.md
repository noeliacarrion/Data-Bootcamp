# Introduction to the Remote Prep

## Module Description

Our pre-work is mandatory. When you become an official student, you're given access to 60 hours of online learning content on the fundamentals of command line, Git, Python, MySQL, and statistical analysis. Completing the pre-work is essential for you to be familiarized with the basic topics in programming and statistics, which are prerequisites for learning data analytics. You will learn those essential topics remotely prior to learning on campus, but you will not be fighting alone in the pre-work thanks to our Slack channel through which you have access to learning peers and academic staff. By the end of the pre-work, you will be ready to take on a fast pace in the on-campus course!

## Module Objectives

* Learn the fundamentals of Command Line, Git, Python, MySQL, and statistical analysis.
* Establish your development environment.
* Test your knowledge of the essential topics with hands-on guided projects at the end of each chapter.
* Get ready and be confident to begin the full-time on-campus course.
